	{Shape Set. This is the basic shape set of Action Geometry.  It has the symmetries and scales of Geometron. What is shown should be printed exactly 6 inches wide, making each shape three inches on a side.}

	{Rulers.  Make this 6 inches wide and each ruler is a 6 inch ruler, 1 inch across, with both tenth and factor of two divisions.}

	\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/actiongeometry/protractor.png}
	\caption[protractor]
	{Geometron protractor.  While not really needed for Action Geometry, this protractor is a nice accessory which emphasizes Geometron symmetries rather than numbers, and allows drawing of circles of radius 3,2 and 1 inch without a compass.  This is mostly useful if cut out with a laser cutter.}

	{Spray paint stencil for laser cutting. You can use the Geometron software, selecting the built in laser font, to make a custom spray paint stencil pointing to the domain name which points to your Geometron server.  If you are Trash Robot, that can be Trash Robot, but we mostly point to a local non-property place.}

	\caption[skeletrontripod]
	{Skeletron tripod.  Three 6 foot bamboo trash poles wrapped in rainbow colored duct tape with quarter inch holes drilled just back from the end.  An 18 inch nylon parachute cord trash tie is used with a square knot to secure the top.  Many things can be hung from this, including servers, terminals, robots, boxes, flags, lights, textile arts and pendants on more trash ties.  The tripod can be carried over the shoulder to be mobile, without untying the joint at the top for rapid deployment.}

	\caption[shook]
	{S-Hook.  Note the repeated use of the square shape, and the use of the 45 degree triangle, making this easy to replicate using the Shape Set.  This hook is used to hang things from the Trash Poles in Skeletron. Fabricate by stacking 4 identical layers of corrugated cardboard cut in this pattern and wrapping them in rainbow colored duct tape.  Googly eyes can then be applied.}

	{Tape Snake.  Duct tape rolls of all useful colors, namely the rainbow colors plus black and pink, are strung on a 6 foot Trash Tie made from a clothesline which is looped through twice and secured with a square knot in a bight(like a bow on a tied shoe) for rapid replacement of rolls as they are used.}

	{ArtBox assembly.  The fully assembled box is a tetrahedron on an octahedron.  It should contain the means of its own replication, which is a box cutter, a ruler, an equilateral triangle, and a sharpie, along with a Tape Snake for duct tape fabrication, extra Trash Ties, and googly eyes.  Use duct tape colors in sequence to create a fully rainbowed effect, then apply googly eyes and add a black duct tape mouth.}
