Icons

The idea of the icon, of a projection of it into the Geometron Hypercube and GVM.

Figure out what you want to do: what do you want to replicate from trash?  Use the idea of self-replicating set theory to make sets.  Represent the sets with icons.  Find the icons, put them in image feeds.  Trace them.  Share them.  Use them in printers.

Tokens are used in a table top game scheme to represent sets which are used to replicate things from trash.  These are carried in water bags, along with the fire and earth bags.  Use AG to construct Sigil Boards for using the Icon Tokens on.
