\section{Trash Robot}

\subsection{What is Trash Robot?}

Trash Robot is a self-replicating set. 

The set contains all the media required to replicate it.  It also contains an Operator, described here, who is the actual human who learns the system and teaches other people to replicate it.  The set is described here, but some of the most minute details of replication will be left out for brevity because they are all described in technical detail in the media transmitted with each instance of any part of Geometron.  That is, any domain on the Street Network, running the Organic Web and Geometron will have scrolls and maps with guide a user through the whole process of replication of this entire set as well as how to use all parts of it.  In this book it is sufficient to simply tell the reader how to find these scrolls and an Operator who can teach them, and they will have the information required to \emph{get} the information to fully replicate the system and become an Operator.


This chapter describes the structure of the SRS called Trash Robot.  It does not explicitly have all the instructions, but it \emph{describes} all the elements, how they are used, and what they are for.  Extreme detail is reserved for the Scrolls.

Everything here refers back to Ontology.  We build this thing, show how to replicate it, show how replication can benefit the replicator, which stimulates further replication.  Build things and sell them. Build things and use them. Build things and share them for mutual aid and benefit. 

Metabusiness.  SRS.  Thing.  Organic Media. Geometron vehicle.  Maker swarm. Methodology.  Trash Magic(self replicating media from trash, seed of full complete set).


Some roles in Trash Robot:

Printer Operator.  You carry a printer with you, and print coins on demand.

Symbol Artist.  Build sets of things, assign them symbols, find those symbols in image form, trace into robot code, save as sharable data, share with people, participate in symbol markets with other people around the world. 

Token replicator.  Carry bags of tokens, stamps, prints, use them to print replications of themselves as well as the tools to further replicate them and sell them or exchange them with other people, again as a global network of self-replicating media.


the terminal, the EXACT terminal, carried by Trash Robots is an element of Trash Robot. 

The Operator is an element of Trash Robot.

The Street Network can be used to sell a huge range of goods and services.  Trash Robot is a specific collection of self-replicating technologies which can also be sold directly via the Street Network.  It includes a list of things which will be described here, which readers are encouraged to copy and sell.  But more importantly it provides a prototype for a new type of product which can be built at scale using the decentralized craft mode of production.  As soon as this book is released and we build a swarm to start living Geometron and selling the elements of Trash Robot and bartering for the services provided by the Network we will also start building totally new products using this method.  We will work to build products which have not exact equivalent on the market in the consumer economy and which would be very difficult to replicate in that space for various logistical reasons of how technology scales.   IN particular we need to explore in this chapter the economics of enclosures and how cardboard and duct tape and geometron built by crafters and immediately sold at a profit on a one-at-a-time basis differs from injection molding of enclosures at scale.  

\subsection{The Operator}

We are the Operators.  We share the elements of Trash Robot with everyone we interact with.  We do whatever we can to help people as much as we can using our tools from Trash Robot, Geometron, the Street Network, and the Organic Web.  We wear the Trash Robot brand, and carry all the tools of Trash Robot.

\subsection{The Open Brand}

rainbow and googly eyes.  Soft black textiles. Felt.  Geometric constructions from Geometron.  Use of geometry in cardboard fabrication, HDPE sheets. Modularity.  Things carried in cloth bags. Blocky geometric font.  duct tape and cardboard and sticks. Things built from trash.  Images of the things: box, flag, shirt, pants, bags with robots.  The fashion brand.  

\subsection{The ArtBox}

As with everything in Trash Robot the ArtBox is a self-replicating set.  The elements are the Trash Ties, the Tape Snake, a purse which is the box itself, and a collection of standard art supplies which sit in the box and are used to make another box.  Trash Ties are 6 foot long sections of cotton clothesline, with the ends duct taped.  We buy a whole package of 100 feet of clothesline, and cut into 6 foot sections, duct taping where the cut will be before cutting so each section has both ends taped.  We then buy a collection of colored duct tapes which includes black, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and pink, or one more if it is available.  We thread the Trash Tie through all of them twice, and join it to itself with a square knot.  This is the Tape Snake.  We carry this around with us to anyplace where we are working on replication. 

The contents of the box are box cutters, sharpie markers, a laser cut acrylic shape set as documented elsewhere in this chapter, and a bag of googly eyes(which can be purchased in bulk online for very little money), scissors, and a ruler, also documented elsewhere here.

\end{figure}


This is a nice purse! If you make one and have the supplies you can go make one with a friend and they can make more and so on.  And as you all make them and grow the swarm you can use them to carry around art supplies for other art projects as a super stylish art supplies purse until people notice and want to buy it, then a market will exist and we will sell them to whoever wants them.  These are so striking and nice to use and cost so little to make and are so easy to copy that they can be a big part of what replicates the whole Trash Robot system which in turn helps replicate all of Geometron and the Street Network.

Now we replicate all the contents, finding another sharpie, another box cutter, etc. and put a whole kit required to make another box in our box to use to make more boxes.  We also replicate the Tape Snake so that the new box has a Snake for replication, and pass some extra Trash Ties along for the next replication as well.}
\end{figure}

We will make millions of these to give away, share, or sell.  The can be freely shared in our Network without money or even barter and just used as needed for other Geometron constructions, but can always be sold to people not in the Network.

\subsection{Laser Cut Acrylic}

The Geometron workflow for creating .svg and .png files is designed among other things to make it as easy as possible to create files to use in commercial laser cutters.  These have been used both in the kind of laser cutter available in maker spaces and from the professional service at Ponoko.com(these require slightly different files).  

Laser neon green acrylic shapes in the basic Shape Set and the 6 inch Geometron ruler are key elements of our system, and replicate along with the rest of the ArtBox.  Making custom or specialized geometry tools like this is a very good metabusiness for Trash Robot.  We can sell the standard Shape Set, sell the Golden Triangle, the 6 inch Ruler, the Geometron Protractor, Penrose Tiles, custom spray stencils using the laser cut stencil font, and just custom arbitrary laser cut shapes for design clients.  

A good design target for custom spray stencils is the domain name which points to the local Geometron Raspberry Pi Server on the Street Network.

\subsection{textiles}

Textile products are an important part of Trash Robot.  We make clothes with the Trash Robot open brand, as well as bags for the various parts of the Trash Robot system and Flags which are used to point to domains on the Street Network, advertise the Trash Robot, and form a surface on which to place Trash Robot elements.

The basic aesthetic of all textile elements of Trash Robot is black cotton flannel with bright rainbow colored felt sewn on.  Everything in this system is designed to be tied using Trash Ties.  These are either 6 foot long clothesline sections terminated in duct tape or 18 inch sections of black nylon parachute cord with ends burned.   Letters printed on the Flags are in the special Trash Robot felt font, which is made from square cutouts of each color of the rainbow in order.  Letters are formed by cutting minimal, simple, geometric pieces out from full squares of felt.  Black sweatpants are sewn with the letters, in all caps spelling out ``TRASH ROBOT'', with one word going down each leg of the pants.  The black cotton t-shirt has the Trash Robot brand logo of the rainbow rectangle with googly eyes and a black rectangle for a mouth.  

Bags are used to carry the Raspberry Pi Geometron Terminal as described in the Street Network, to carry the clay icon tablet printer described in this section, and to carry the three types of clay tablet: prints, stamps, and finished tokens.  Prints are printed directly by the printer robot, and are in small black flannel bags with a symbol for the alchemy element ``earth''

The exact dimensions of the various bags are given in the Scrolls that replicate with all instances of Trash Robot, as well as on physical Replicator cards distributed with the physical set Trash Robot. 


\subsection{The icon token printer robot}

The exact description of how to replicate the printer is given in the Scrolls distributed with Geometron/Trash Robot. These scrolls should be readable on any local Raspberry Pi server running the latest version, as well as any Street domain like www.us29.xyz or global domains like www.trashrobot.org.  The exact means of operation of the printer is also documented in the Scrolls.  In this manuscript we discuss how this all fits together, and rely on the instances of the software to transmit the details of replication.

Build the brain. 

Build the controller. 

Build the mechanicals.  

Workflow:  image feeds, align, trace, share, print, bake, stamp, replicate, paint and sand, build into sets, share and sell, make pendants, stitch into clothing and accessories, make jewelry. Make more robots. Donate, share, and sell robots. 

The symbolic currency, creating sets, the sigil boards, sets as fashion, sets as symbolic currency which can mean \emph{anything}.  This symbolic currency goes back to the previous chapter, where we discuss the general idea of self-replicating sets. For any given set of generalized ``things'' in the sense of the previous chapter, each thing can be assigned a symbol.  That symbol can be traced into the robot code which drives the printer.  All those symbols can be stored as a token feed which is saved and shared with other users, who can then print them all out.  So an abstract set can always be represented by a collection of Geometron icon symbols shared over a network and also a collection of clay painted icon tokens, carried in a bag as described in the Textiles section of this chapter, and replicated using more clay without use of a robot.  So we can represent any self-replicating set with a set of symbols shared over both a local and global network and \emph{also} a collection of physical tokens in a bag which are like coins in a coin purse. Attractive and convenient coin purses which contain symbols representing a self-replicating set which themselves are self-replicating media can form the basis of a very powerful symbolic economy based on sets, networks, and symbols rather than numbers.  

The creation of a self-replicating symbolic currency which has both physical and digital versions is a fundamentally different type of currency than money.  Because it all self-replicates, the idea of property simply does not make sense, because the value of replication is reversed.  If I own a plot of land or a car, its value is based on how hard it is to replicate.  If it were possible to freely replicate a billion acres of the best land imaginable with warp drive to get to the best location, your million dollar plot of land will be worthless.  If someone builds a free car that grows naturally in a forest and runs on the sun, your 40,000 dollar gas car will be worthless.  But if you build a robot from trash to fabricate useful things, the more people copy the robot the more value there is in the whole network. If a billion people copy my robot, I can get a million of the cleverest makers in the world all improving the design, and what I end up using a few years from now light years beyond anything I could have even dreamed of.  So the more people replicate a free thing the \emph{more} that thing is worth to me, even as the creator of the thing.  This makes the way value works the opposite of property.  Value goes up with abundance rather than scarcity.  If we make the choice to value abundance, meaning the freeness of things, then that is what will end up with value.  But this replication also means that any numerical unit of value will very quickly break as the supply of value exceeds the total currency available again and again(essentially deflation).  

Some notes on the pi version, how this can be a pi driven robot.
