outline:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  what and Why?  The power of the physical, local, and free.  Organic media, what we want, links to previous chapter.  Universal social media for sharing of information in a physically local domain with both content creation and consumption on all Web-enabled devices(laptops, phones, tablets, etc.)  Hybrid markets: like Craigslist, but way more local.  General description of what the system does(scrolls,maps, feeds, symbols, apps, industrial design and production via Trash Robot). This points to the subsequent chapters about these actual things.  Free boxes and food not bombs.  We are a hybrid between free boxes and food not bombs and craigslist.
  \item
  The Terminal.  This is the heart of this system. What is the Raspberry Pi, why is it powerful?  How to build the Terminal. Options involving big screens and projectors, public terminals with large publicly viewable displays.  How to adapt it to different situations, how to work with wifi networks, IP addresses, local and global, opening up a local wifi to a public domain.  how to avoid ANY property.  How the terminal is passed from user to user to operator to operator.  Data hygiene: how to keep all personal information of any kind of the machine, to prevent leaks of property.  What it means to have a network without property.  Replication paths via local laptops(localhost) on wifi, global github repos, replication to global hosted domains. How to constantly back up and replicate to avoid information death.  How to kill bad information.  How to nuke the whole system if it's too rotten.  Grey market and black market commerce.
  \item
  The Operators, what we are, what we do, how we do it, how we make money and barter, how we train new Operators .  Role of Operator as universal moderator.  Forking and avoiding the trap of the network monopolist.  How to transition between money to barter, how to scale up to an all barter system by providing value for 
  \item
  Psychogeography.  Nodes of power, examples at global level and local level, finding the nodal points.  Go through the whole philosophy, places, examples such as: parks, intersections, neighborhoods, famous landmarks, bridges, forking below a place, discussion of distance scales and granularity.  Targeting nodes of power: Sand Hill Road. Wall Street. SoMa.  K Street DC. Jackson Hole. Martha's Vinyard.  Navy Memorial DC. Use of power nodes to build extremely powerful local networks, where information is exchanged between players in existing power networks.  A network in the right coffee shop could connect people who collectively are processing 10's of billions of dollars of commerce just in that one coffee shop!
  \item
  domains.  choosing domains, buying them, sharing them, avoiding troubles. Entropy of domain choice, size of name space. use of free web hosting services.  Signs, markers, stencils, postcards: physical media which points to domains which point to terminals and link to the IP addresses.  The work flow with physical media to software media and back.
  \item
  The market
  \item
  the coffee shop(or pub) node.  How it can build community in the coffee shop, help all coffee shop customers to share and prosper, help neighbors of coffee shop, the developer workflow, use to expand operators.  Coffee shop network as service for coffee shop owner for barter for coffee and food at shop.  Building collaboration with businesses, both local and global, how to use global chains to scale globally with mutual aid and benefit for all.
  \item
  scaling up: the global swarm, going to full stack geometron(see last chapter), building more

\subsection{What is the Street Network?}

We want an information network based around physical replication of technology from trash.  To stimulate the replication of the Network, we need it to create value for people who use it and operate it. This value can be of many kinds: it can directly provide physical goods people need, it can facilitate business in the monetary economy, it can provide mutual aid to a community, it can create local social connections, can build network power for users, and any of these values can be traded for materials and space needed to continue to expand the network.  

This book will describe several products and services which Operators in the network can provide to local users.  These can be exchanged for money or bartered directly for materials to expand the system(for instance one can ask users who are paying for goods or services to simply buy more computer equipment to build out more network infrastructure.)  We aim to have the goods sold be as much as possible based on a stream of trash which are upcycled into sellable products.  The prototype product here is a purse, the ArtBox, which can be constructed using the methods of Geometron and which contains the tools to replicate itself.  It is, in essence, a self-replicating purse with a unique Open Brand, the Trash Robot Brand, which will be documented in its own chapter.  

Services rendered will generally be of the kind which makes money for the user.  So for instance a passerby might place an advertisement on a news scroll for a local coffee shop for their service which other coffee shop customers(this is all over the wifi network of the coffee shop so everyone is indeed a customer) might want.  This makes the user money, which motivates them to come back and place more ads, so they are making money which they can pay to the Operator.  All of this commerce then motivates people to come into the coffee shop and read and share documents.  Since wifi has a time limit and requires purchase, this brings higher traffic to the coffee shop, which then has their revenue go up, so to keep the system running, it is worth it to them to barter snacks and coffee to the Operator of the network.  

Structure and purpose of the network: domains, places, operators, mutual aid, markets, 

Networks are advertised with physical media which points to domains which point to physical places, specifically to the location of the physical web server, and have a hyperlink which only works on the local wifi network which links to the web server on that network.

The Street Network is social media based around physically local instances of the Web which are not on the public Internet.  Wifi networks are used to share documents locally with other users on the same network.  The Geometron servers function as public bulletin boards, where documents are shared freely with all other users. Any user can edit or delete any file. All files can be copied by anyone.  Documents are all visible by both mobile devices and computers, as long as they are on the same wifi network.  The Street Network is an example of Organic Media. It is intended to facilitate replication by users.  Users can create and share documents advertising whatever commerce they wish to engage in: they can sell things, share ideas, give things away for free, advertise services, advertise businesses, describe how to make things, or look for others with shared interests.  There are no users and no databases.  There is just a list of documents which users can click on to read, edit using the editors or delete using the file deletion tools.

The Geometron documents are stored on a Geometron Terminal, which is based on the Raspberry Pi mini-computer.  Raspberry Pi is a non profit project from the UK to create a minimalist Linux based computer, mostly for education, research, art, and maker hobbies.   They can be purchased easily online for approximately 50 US Dollars.  The two most widely used formats of Geometron documents are the Scroll and the Map.  A scroll is just a text file, with some formatting in a markup language called Markdown.

\end{itemize}

Put it together.  Just assemble the Sunfounder terminal as per the instructions.  

If you have a display that does not have a mount for the Pi, build an integrated terminal with cardboard, duct tape, and plastic HDPE sheet from milk bottles.

Burn the card with NOOBS, put it in the Pi.

Use paint pens to put symbols on keyboard.

plug in mouse and keyboard.

Make a bag to carry the terminal around in, or find an appropriate backpack and sew symbol onto it.  Symbol of Raspberry Pi using Penrose Tiles.

Boot up the pi, set it up with no password

Install Apache and php

copy the Geometron code replicator script replicator.php into the web directory. THis can be found from any geometron server at [serverurl]/php/replicator.txt.  

Learn to use with subsequent chapters of this book, customize and deploy, replicate to other people

\subsection{Street Market}
We help people sell stuff directly on the Street, out in the open, with a sign advertising the Market.  People can sell for barter.  We also sell directly the items from Trash Robot and other Geometron Things described below.  These include the ArtBox as a purse, shirts, pants, flags, bags, clay icon tokens, robots, terminals, laser cut acrylic shapes and rulers and protractors, Pyramids,

The \href{scrolls/terminal.md}{Terminal} is a
\href{https://www.raspberrypi.org/}{Raspberry Pi} with a keyboard,
mouse, display and power supply, which run a web server only visible
over the local wifi network. It is carried by the Operator, who uses it
to help users create, edit, copy, and share files over the local
network.

The files on the Network can be: - \href{scrolls/scrolls.md}{Scrolls}.
These are a type of text file which uses the
\href{https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/}{Markdown markup
language} for formatting.\\
- \href{scrolls/feeds.md}{Feeds}. Feeds are either a directory with a
sequence of files a user can scroll through and select or an array of
any kind of information, be it images, symbols, words, links, etc. -
\href{scrolls/maps.md}{Maps}. A map is a sort of generalized meme, like
a PowerPoint or Keynote slide. It is an array of elements each of which
has a position, angle, width, possibly an image url, some text, and
possibly a link destination, which might be either a HTML hyperlink or
an internal link to a file on the system

All users on the same wifi network as the Terminal can view, edit,
delete, and copy all the files on the system. There are no user names,
no logins, no passwords, no private data, and no databases.

Users can all see all files, edit them, delete them, copy/paste them,
create new ones

Operators carry the Terminal around, share its link with people, talk to
people about the system, teach users to use the system, help to share
with new Operators.

Roles of the Operator:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the keeper of the physical Terminal
\item
  maintain relationships with users of the Terminal and Domain
\item
  update the Geometron server at the hosted Domain with links to the IP
  address on the local wifi network of the Terminal, as well as the wifi
  network name and password or link to where to get it(e.g.~coffee shop
  register)
\item
  post ads for money or barter on the Geometron server at the hosted
  Domain for people who ask
\item
  post on the global Geometron server when and where the Operator will
  appear, or where the terminal is set up on what network if it's
  installed permanently.
\item
  Teach anyone who wants to learn how to be an Operator, recruit new
  Operators
\item
  Tell new users about the Network, teach them to use it, how to post,
  edit, delete
\item
  Promote any kind of business or other venture or project anyone
  physically local to the wifi network area has in exchange for barter
  with that user for useful things on location(including just a place to
  operate)
\item
  Spread Network into new places by finding a location with a wifi
  network, buying a domain and setting up hosting or getting someone to
  do that and pay for it,
\item
  Domain names spread in physical space using physical media with
  depiction of domain which points back to terminal ip address, wifi
  address and password, photo of terminal and operator other physical
  media(post cards, book marks, spray paint stencils), spreading the
  physical media with the domain name
