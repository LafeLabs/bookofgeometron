  what and Why?  The power of the physical, local, and free.  Organic media, what we want, links to previous chapter.  Universal social media for sharing of information in a physically local domain with both content creation and consumption on all Web-enabled devices(laptops, phones, tablets, etc.)  Hybrid markets: like Craigslist, but way more local.  General description of what the system does(scrolls,maps, feeds, symbols, apps, industrial design and production via Trash Robot). This points to the subsequent chapters about these actual things.  Free boxes and food not bombs.  We are a hybrid between free boxes and food not bombs and craigslist.

  The Terminal.  This is the heart of this system. What is the Raspberry Pi, why is it powerful?  How to build the Terminal. Options involving big screens and projectors, public terminals with large publicly viewable displays.  How to adapt it to different situations, how to work with wifi networks, IP addresses, local and global, opening up a local wifi to a public domain.  how to avoid ANY property.  How the terminal is passed from user to user to operator to operator.  Data hygiene: how to keep all personal information of any kind of the machine, to prevent leaks of property.  What it means to have a network without property.  Replication paths via local laptops(localhost) on wifi, global github repos, replication to global hosted domains. How to constantly back up and replicate to avoid information death.  How to kill bad information.  How to nuke the whole system if it's too rotten.  Grey market and black market commerce.

\subsection{What is the Street Network?}

We want an information network based around physical replication of technology from trash.  To stimulate the replication of the Network, we need it to create value for people who use it and operate it. This value can be of many kinds: it can directly provide physical goods people need, it can facilitate business in the monetary economy, it can provide mutual aid to a community, it can create local social connections, can build network power for users, and any of these values can be traded for materials and space needed to continue to expand the network.  

This book will describe several products and services which Operators in the network can provide to local users.  These can be exchanged for money or bartered directly for materials to expand the system(for instance one can ask users who are paying for goods or services to simply buy more computer equipment to build out more network infrastructure.)  We aim to have the goods sold be as much as possible based on a stream of trash which are upcycled into sellable products.  The prototype product here is a purse, the ArtBox, which can be constructed using the methods of Geometron and which contains the tools to replicate itself.  It is, in essence, a self-replicating purse with a unique Open Brand, the Trash Robot Brand, which will be documented in its own chapter.  

Services rendered will generally be of the kind which makes money for the user.  So for instance a passerby might place an advertisement on a news scroll for a local coffee shop for their service which other coffee shop customers(this is all over the wifi network of the coffee shop so everyone is indeed a customer) might want.  This makes the user money, which motivates them to come back and place more ads, so they are making money which they can pay to the Operator.  All of this commerce then motivates people to come into the coffee shop and read and share documents.  Since wifi has a time limit and requires purchase, this brings higher traffic to the coffee shop, which then has their revenue go up, so to keep the system running, it is worth it to them to barter snacks and coffee to the Operator of the network.  

Structure and purpose of the network: domains, places, operators, mutual aid, markets, 

Networks are advertised with physical media which points to domains which point to physical places, specifically to the location of the physical web server, and have a hyperlink which only works on the local wifi network which links to the web server on that network.

The Street Network is social media based around physically local instances of the Web which are not on the public Internet.  Wifi networks are used to share documents locally with other users on the same network.  The Geometron servers function as public bulletin boards, where documents are shared freely with all other users. Any user can edit or delete any file. All files can be copied by anyone.  Documents are all visible by both mobile devices and computers, as long as they are on the same wifi network.  The Street Network is an example of Organic Media. It is intended to facilitate replication by users.  Users can create and share documents advertising whatever commerce they wish to engage in: they can sell things, share ideas, give things away for free, advertise services, advertise businesses, describe how to make things, or look for others with shared interests.  There are no users and no databases.  There is just a list of documents which users can click on to read, edit using the editors or delete using the file deletion tools.

The Geometron documents are stored on a Geometron Terminal, which is based on the Raspberry Pi mini-computer.  Raspberry Pi is a non profit project from the UK to create a minimalist Linux based computer, mostly for education, research, art, and maker hobbies.   They can be purchased easily online for approximately 50 US Dollars.  The two most widely used formats of Geometron documents are the Scroll and the Map.  A scroll is just a text file, with some formatting in a markup language called Markdown.

\subsection{use cases}

Traveling kids, hobos, panhandlers, people asking for money on the street corner.  A physically local free bulletin board shared by passerby in a high traffic area can allow people asking for money who are currently ignored by passerby as just another anonymous face and cardboard sign a chance to really tell their stories and to share all that they have to share.  When people share their stories they can become part of the emergent physical community of passerby in a location where the network node is located.  When people view others as part of their community they not only are more willing to help, they can have open communication about the best way to help, expanding from just spare change to more comprehensive mutual aid.  Because we clone content from the local terminal to web pages on globally visible domains linked to a physical place, which are advertised everywhere in that place, marginalized people whose only ability to get online is the public library can use the computers there to get the information they need to better survive, and ultimately to thrive and build new communities where they already are.  The way a local network can help people is twofold. First, it is direct, by asking for money and other mutual aid.  But by being physically on location all the time, already with physical media(cardboard signs), people in a given place can aid the network, creating value for the other people in the community who are more resourced, who then no longer view monetary support as ``donation'', but rather as an expense which supports their other business activities.  

In order to see the power of this second means of network support of marginalized people on the street, we have to look more closely at the network nodes we are building.  One of the major types of node is in a business district of a city where there are both homeless people asking for money, on the street all day with physical media, and power brokers who make their living entirely from connections.  These people include venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, lobbyists, consultants, and the rest of what might be called the ``deal-making class''.  An example of this confluence is some of the parks along K-Street in Washington DC.  K Street and adjacent streets is home to a huge homeless population as well as power brokers whose livelihood depends entirely on connections.  If a physical network were built which facilitated direct communication between people along K Street,

The elements of traveler culture which overlap with ``van life'' are also key to increasing the network effects of the Street Network.  This also links to trucker networks.  People who live their lives on the road can use this network infrastructure to set up complex networks and markets in highway rest stops, Walmart parking lots etc. using either wifi networks in these places.  These networks can be of utility to passerby of all kinds, from tourists to truckers to the workers who keep the places running.  Just as existing global social media networks provide value they can charge money for, a physically local network can provide value which people will pay for.  An example use case here is a Street Network Operator agreeing to maintain a backup of and keep posting an advertisement for something a local entrepreneur is trying to sell to truckers.  In exchange for that, they can get directly compensated in gas, right there in the rest stop, without money changing hands.  


Food not bombs, street outreach, harm reduction people, mutual aid workers.  See above.  The people who are working to help the most marginalized members of any given community can better reach that community if there is a physically local media platform where people can share information about resources.  Documents can be posted which explain how to get access to resources, when and where resources will be available, etc.  Because the whole system self-replicates, as with Food Not Bombs, anything which is successful in any given place can be immediately cloned to other nodes on the network.  Food Not Bombs already has a global network of free and open nodes with no property but a very recognizable brand identity and set of behaviors and actions.  FNB nodes are generally already linked by networks both online and via people who travel from one punk house or FNB house to the next.  The whole anarchist network of community houses, FNB's, anarchist infoshops and bookstores, really really free markets, free boxes, etc. can form a basis for a truly free information network carried from house to house and city to city, running on house wifi networks.  

Coffee shop owners.  Building a network in a coffee shop on the wifi network which requires purchase to use and which has a time limit can create a huge amount of added business for any local business owner.  It also builds community. So coffee shop owners who find themselves with a full shop of laptop drones with headphones on who work for hours, or get kicked out and do the same thing somewhere else can instead find themselves the brokers in a very powerful information network.  Much of the commerce of the world is now code written in coffee shops on laptops.  Creating physically local networks around these already existing groups can create huge power for the users which then benefits the people who set up the infrastructure(again, just like existing centralized social media platforms.)

Developers.  We need developers to be constantly writing more and better software in order to make Geometron a success. Developers who work all day in coffee shops or any other shared space like a co-working space or pub can have a social network based on both co-developing applications useful to all and sharing other resources.  Developers will use the resource of the Street Network terminal/server on the local network in the same basic way as others: they can share their resumes, links to pages of personal projects,

Power brokers. Venture capitalists, financiers, entrepreneurs, deal-makers of all kinds, lobbyists, politicians.  Your network is your power.  Geography matters.  Build a network in the lobby.  Post things on street nodes, build your network, build your power, build your literal street cred. 

Crafters, makers, jewelers, artists.  An alternative to Etsy, street vending, or being in a shop.  Post your stuff to the local networks.  This is much more free and long form than existing platforms, you can post images, descriptions, contact info, times and places when you'll be in a place.  This can be way easier than other sales channels for arts and crafts.  You can say when and where you'll be at a place, post a link for contact, and then show up in the network node like a coffee shop to make the physical exchange.  In many cases, because the network is physical and local, there will be barter opportunities as well as direct sales.  A barter economy can develop where people donate materials you use for your crafts as part of how they pay for the finished product.  Removing shipping or transport costs by dealing directly in a physical location removes friction from the market, amplifying dramatically the power of the market, especially for crafts which involve physically bulky objects.  For instance, people can bring in motors and properly prepared plastic sheets and cardboard, as well as rolls and rolls of duct tape, and we can exchange finished products built from these materials and tools, as well as free food, drinks, and supplies, creating a market economy without money as well as without formal business structures(making it easier for marginalized people to participate).

Trash Robot.  Trash robot will be described later in this work.  It is a system of technology which can be used to build products from a combination of waste streams and consumer off the shelf(COTS) products, which has a clearly recognizable brand identity owned by no one and provides value to an end consumer.  Trash Robot is a meta-business: a system for people to build businesses which can use both barter and sales to make money on the Geometron Street Network, further facilitating the replication of that network. If the right people start doing Trash Robot on the Network, we can create a system which has a significant consumer demand.  Trash Robot is structured to be very easy to replicate for an individual but very hard to replicate for a for profit centralized technology company driven by building up value in their equity.  This means if we can build up a significant consumer demand, it will provide a very powerful stimulus to replicating the nodes to grow our network, always as a free decentralized system.  Building a thing that replicates faster than property that is not property is how we start building a society without property.  This is described in detail it its own chapter later in this book.

The \href{scrolls/terminal.md}{Terminal} is a
\href{https://www.raspberrypi.org/}{Raspberry Pi} with a keyboard,
mouse, display and power supply, which run a web server only visible
over the local wifi network. It is carried by the Operator, who uses it
to help users create, edit, copy, and share files over the local
network.

The files on the Network can be: - \href{scrolls/scrolls.md}{Scrolls}.
These are a type of text file which uses the
\href{https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/}{Markdown markup
language} for formatting.\\
- \href{scrolls/feeds.md}{Feeds}. Feeds are either a directory with a
sequence of files a user can scroll through and select or an array of
any kind of information, be it images, symbols, words, links, etc. -
\href{scrolls/maps.md}{Maps}. A map is a sort of generalized meme, like
a PowerPoint or Keynote slide. It is an array of elements each of which
has a position, angle, width, possibly an image url, some text, and
possibly a link destination, which might be either a HTML hyperlink or
an internal link to a file on the system

All users on the same wifi network as the Terminal can view, edit,
delete, and copy all the files on the system. There are no user names,
no logins, no passwords, no private data, and no databases.

Users can all see all files, edit them, delete them, copy/paste them,
create new ones

Operators carry the Terminal around, share its link with people, talk to
people about the system, teach users to use the system, help to share
with new Operators.

Roles of the Operator:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the keeper of the physical Terminal
\item
  maintain relationships with users of the Terminal and Domain
\item
  update the Geometron server at the hosted Domain with links to the IP
  address on the local wifi network of the Terminal, as well as the wifi
  network name and password or link to where to get it(e.g.~coffee shop
  register)
\item
  post ads for money or barter on the Geometron server at the hosted
  Domain for people who ask
\item
  post on the global Geometron server when and where the Operator will
  appear, or where the terminal is set up on what network if it's
  installed permanently.
\item
  Teach anyone who wants to learn how to be an Operator, recruit new
  Operators
\item
  Tell new users about the Network, teach them to use it, how to post,
  edit, delete
\item
  Promote any kind of business or other venture or project anyone
  physically local to the wifi network area has in exchange for barter
  with that user for useful things on location(including just a place to
  operate)
\item
  Spread Network into new places by finding a location with a wifi
  network, buying a domain and setting up hosting or getting someone to
  do that and pay for it,
\item
  Domain names spread in physical space using physical media with
  depiction of domain which points back to terminal ip address, wifi
  address and password, photo of terminal and operator other physical
  media(post cards, book marks, spray paint stencils), spreading the
  physical media with the domain name
